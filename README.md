# Short Range RF-Induced Emotional States in a Given Subject

## Overview

This framework is designed to explore the intersection of Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology and hemi-sync concepts by utilizing short-range RF vibrations to induce specific emotional responses in subjects. By leveraging the principles of Jungian archetypes and vibrational frequencies, this project creates states within the subject that resonate within the subconscious mind.

## Features

- **Short-Range RF Transmission**: Utilize SDR technology to transmit RF signals over short distances, allowing for controlled environments.
- **Frequency Mapping**: Implement a library of vibrational frequencies associated with various archetypes and emotional states.
- **Real-Time Signal Processing**: Process and modulate signals in real-time to create dynamic and responsive experiences.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface for selecting frequencies, adjusting parameters, and monitoring signal output.
- **Experimental Framework**: Tools and documentation for conducting experiments and gathering data on emotional responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A compatible SDR device (e.g., RTL-SDR, HackRF, etc.)
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hemi-sync-sdr
   cd jungian-sdr

2. Install the requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Connect to your SDR Device.
4. Launch application/
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
